GrapheneOS bundles the AOSP keyboard which was the open source code from Google Keyboard back in 2014/2015 before the rebrand to Gboard. GrapheneOS [disables](https://grapheneos.org/features#:~:text=personalized%20keyboard%20suggestions%20based%20on%20gathering%20input%20history%20are%20disabled%20by%20default) personalized sughestions by default.




The only current alternative keyboard app which could become viable to replace AOSP Keyboard in GrapheneOS is FlorisBoard due to being permiesively licenced and a high quality app. It current lacks features even the AOSP Keyboard has such as predictive text/spell checking so it's not ready yet. They [plan](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#05) to add word suggestions in v0.5.
