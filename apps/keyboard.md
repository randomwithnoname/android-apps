GrapheneOS bundles the AOSP keyboard which was the open source code from Google Keyboard back in 2014/2015 before the rebrand to Gboard. GrapheneOS [disables](https://grapheneos.org/features#:~:text=personalized%20keyboard%20suggestions%20based%20on%20gathering%20input%20history%20are%20disabled%20by%20default) personalized sughestions by default.

Gboard is probably going to be the best option for most users as it's a modern, well maintained, high quality keyboard app with support for most languages and predictive text/spellcheck. You should opt out of the usage stats in Gboard -> Privacy settings.

HeliBoard is a fork of OpenBoard which was a fork of the AOSP Keyboard. It has a lot of features in comparison and is overall a good app but still lacks a modern dictionary (it's about 10 years out-of-date, it has no clue what COVID is...)

FUTO Keyboard is a fork of the AOSP Keyboard but has gone in a very different direction to the other forks. They've added a better dictionary than even Gboard as well as on-device speech-to-text via OpenAI Whisper. You can also use Transcribro for speech-to-text.


The only current alternative keyboard app which could become viable to replace AOSP Keyboard in GrapheneOS is FlorisBoard due to being permiesively licenced and a high quality app. It current lacks features even the AOSP Keyboard has such as predictive text/spell checking so it's not ready yet. They [plan](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#05) to add word suggestions in v0.5.
