Email should be avoided for the purposes of any sensitive communications. Rather than switching to a privacy-focused provider to try and achieve privacy, convince people to switch to a [secure messaging](./secure-messaging.md) app instead.

If your email provider provides a decent web client it's best to use that to avoid installing more apps (attack surface). Alternatively, using the official app from your email provider can be a good option as it avoids trusting more parties.

Thunderbird is a great option for people who want something open source or possibly better than what their provider offers.
