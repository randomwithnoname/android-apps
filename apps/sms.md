Legacy carrier communication [should be avoided](https://grapheneos.org/faq#:~:text=Legacy%20calls%20and,doomed%20to%20failure). You should instead use secure messaging apps with the Signal protocol implemented properly when possible.

Google Messages is the ONLY app with end-to-end encrypted RCS support.
