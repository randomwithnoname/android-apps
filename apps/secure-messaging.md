Signal is the obvious recommendation from cryptographers and information security experts as it is an easy to use app with properly implemented end-to-end encryption. It's worth noting that you have to verify safety numbers with contacts manually to ensure you've not suffered a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).



Molly is an improved version of Signal for Android users. Regardless of the other features it provides, it fixes the egregious battery drain when not using FCM (push notifications via Google Play services). That's a good enough reason to use it.

The fix was [submitted](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/13337) to Signal nearly over a year ago and they've completely ignored it. Someone with influence ought to convince them to merge it.
