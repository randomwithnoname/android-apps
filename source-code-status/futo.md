FUTO is a company that's trying to exert control over open source and profit from it while publishing software they pretend is open source but in reality has incredibly restrictive non-open-source licensing. It harms real open source projects.

FUTO Keyboard and other new FUTO apps are source available, not open source.

A real world example of this being problematic is that their keyboard app can't be used in GrapheneOS...

Contributions are going to be taken away from projects that could be used like FlorisBoard and they'll become irrelevant.
